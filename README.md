# GIPHY-API

## JavaScript App

The user is allowed to click on a animal name or search for a animal not listed

Once the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing
